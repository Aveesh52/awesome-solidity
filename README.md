## Getting Started

- [ERC20 Token Standard](https://theethereum.wiki/w/index.php/ERC20_Token_Standard) - The ERC20 token standard describes the functions and events that an Ethereum token contract has to implement.

## Testing

- [Truffle](https://github.com/trufflesuite/truffle) - Truffle is a development environment, testing framework and asset pipeline for Ethereum, aiming to make life as an Ethereum developer easier.
- [TestRPC](https://github.com/ethereumjs/testrpc) - Fast Ethereum RPC client for testing and development.

## Libraries

## Best Practice

- [OpenZeppelin Contracts](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/zeppelin-solidity) - A framework to build secure smart contracts on Ethereum.
  - [SafeMath](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/zeppelin-solidity/blob/master/contracts/math/SafeMath.sol) - Safely perform mathematical operations.

## MulstiSig Wallets

- [Gnosis MultiSig](https://github.com/gnosis/MultiSigWallet) - Popular multisig deployed by the likes of District0x, Golem, Aragon, Bancor, and more..

## Smart Contract Examples

## Tokens

- [OpenZeppelin Base Tokens](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/zeppelin-solidity/tree/master/contracts/token) - Collection of basic token skeletons to extend.
- [MiniMe Token](https://github.com/Giveth/minime) - The MiniMeToken contract is a standard ERC20 token with extra functionality.

## Crowd Sales

- [Status.im Crowdsale](https://github.com/status-im/status-network-token/tree/master/contracts) - Crowdsale contracts from Status.
